# Next.js Starter

This is a template project for spinning up new next.js projects. The goal was to consolidate the setup of many things I find myself setting up regularly such as next auth, database connections, ES Lint settings, Next UI... 

## Getting Started

As this is a template repository, you can simply use the `Use this template` feature to create your own repository with this as a base!

Once you've got your repository setup, or this one cloned, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Copy the `.env` file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Update the following values in the `.env` file:

```sh
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-value-here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-value-here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-value-here
```

4. Start the database:

```sh
docker compose up
```

5. Migrate the database:

```sh
npm run db:migrate
```

6. Start the app:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Helpful Commands

When using this template, here are some helpful commands you will likely need to run:

- Generate migrations with Drizzle:

```sh
npx drizzle-kit generate
```

- View data in database:

```sh
npx drizzle-kit studio
```

- Format code:

```sh
npm run format
```

- Migrate the database:

```sh
npm run db:migrate
```
